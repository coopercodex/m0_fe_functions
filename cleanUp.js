// Each example below has at least one opportunity for improvement.

// YOUR TASK:
  // Modify the code to make that improvement(s)
  // write a JS comment to explain what you changed, and why
  // make sure the code you submit WORKS - you can run this entire file
    // using `node cleanUp.js` or copy and paste into a replit


// EX 1:
function nameQuestion() {
  console.log("Hello, what is your name?");
};

nameQuestion();
 // just added ; to make code easier to read

// EX 2:
function addThreeNums(first, second, third) {
var sum = first + second + third;
console.log(sum);
};

addThreeNums(1, 2, 3);
addThreeNums(4, 2, 7);
// just added spaces and ; to make code easier to read

// EX 3:
function makeFreshPesto() {
  console.log("Buy ingredients: basil, parmesan, romano, olive oil, pine nuts, garlic, salt, pepper");
  console.log("Pulse basil and pine nuts");
  console.log("Add garlic and cheeses");
  console.log("Slowly pour in oil");
  console.log("Season");
};

makeFreshPesto();
// function was not spelled out code wont run.  Added ; and spaces to make it easier to read

//  EX 4:
function average(num1, num2)  {
var sum = num1 + num2;
var avg = sum / 2;

  console.log(`the average is: ${avg}`);
};

average(1,2);
// added/deleted spaces to make easier to read. Added call function and added arguments so code would run.
